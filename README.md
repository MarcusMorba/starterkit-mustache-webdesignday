# starterkit-mustache-webdesignday

A sample pattern tree built for the Atomic Design / Pattern Lab workshop at Web Design Day 2016 on June 23rd 2016

This starterkit is built in stages, with each stage a separate branch. Pattern Lab can target individual branches during starterkit loading, bringing all users back to a consistent state when desired.

The stages contained in this repository are:

* exercise 1 start
  ```
  pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday#exercise1start
  ```
* exercise 2 start
  ```
  pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday#exercise2start
  ```
* complete
  ```
  pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday#complete
  ```

You can use starterkit loading commands to import starterkits.

#### PHP

Forthcoming

#### Node

The gist is, from a command prompt:

``` bash
npm install pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday#exercise1start
gulp patternlab:loadstarterkit --kit=starterkit-mustache-webdesignday --clean=true
```

Follow instructions as defined on the wiki: [https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Importing-Starterkits](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Importing-Starterkits).

* Sometimes users will run into file permissions issues. It's recommended to run all command prompts as administrator if you can.
