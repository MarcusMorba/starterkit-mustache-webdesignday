# starterkit-mustache-webdesignday

A sample pattern tree built for the Atomic Design / Pattern Lab workshop at Web Design Day 2016 on June 23rd 2016

This starterkit is built in stages, with each stage a separate branch. Pattern Lab can target individual branches during starterkit loading, bringing all users back to a consistent state when desired.

The stages contained in this repository are:

* exercise 1 start
  ```
  pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday#exercise1start
  ```
* exercise 2 start
  ```
  pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday#exercise2start
  ```
* complete
  ```
  pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday#complete
  ```
