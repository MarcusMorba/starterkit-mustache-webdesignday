[Butler by Fabien De Smet](https://fabiandesmet.com/portfolio/butler-font/) is a "typeface inspired by a mix between both Dala Floda & the amazing Bodoni family. The main goal was to bring a bit of modernism to serif fonts by working on the curves of classical serif fonts and adding an extra stencil family."

It evokes authoritative yet relaxed tone that is important to the Gaslight Review.
